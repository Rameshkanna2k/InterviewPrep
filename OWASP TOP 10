BROKEN ACCESS CONTROL:

Definitions:
Broken Access Control means that a user can access parts of an application that they’re not supposed to.In web applications, broken access control flaws allow users to see or change information that should be restricted. 
For example, a regular user might be able to view other users data or perform actions meant only for administrators. 

Impact:
This can lead to privacy issues, data leaks, or users gaining access to higher-level controls they shouldn't have

Common Use cases:
Platform Misconfiguration
When security settings aren’t properly configured, like leaving the ‘debug’ mode on in a live environment, it can lead to broken access control. This kind of setup error can make it easy for attackers to access areas they shouldn’t. Often, this happens due to oversight or weak security checks during setup.
Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
If an application allows users to directly access internal data through URLs or object IDs, they might change IDs to access other users’ data. For example, changing “example.com/account?id=123” to “example.com/account?id=456” could let someone see another person’s account. This is a form of broken access control.
Mass Assignment
When an application automatically fills in data based on user input, attackers may exploit this to modify properties they shouldn’t. For instance, they might change their role from ‘user’ to ‘admin’ or access restricted data. This happens if the app doesn’t carefully control what users can modify.
URL Matching Discrepancies
Sometimes, an app treats similar-looking URLs the same, like “/ADMIN/deleteUser” and “/admin/deleteUser,” but doesn’t apply access controls consistently. Attackers can use this to access pages they’re not supposed to.
Referer Headers & Broken Access Control
Some sites use the HTTP Referer Header to control access, checking if users came from the main admin page before allowing access to subpages like “/admin/deleteUser.” However, attackers can fake the Referer Header to bypass these checks and access restricted pages, leading to unauthorized access.

Fix:
Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Enforce Access Checks on Every Request
Avoid Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Apply URL Path and Parameter Validation
Disable Debug and Development Features in Production
Use Secure Attribute Mapping and Control for Mass Assignment
Leverage Strong Session Management
Regularly Audit and Test Access Control Rules
Do Not Rely on HTTP Referer Headers
Implement Logging and Monitoring

CRYPTOGRAPHY FAILURES:

Cryptography is important in today’s computing world. It is implemented in technologies like:

    Protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, SFTP, SSH, SMTPS, etc. to ensure that all communication between two endpoints are encrypted.
    Hashing (one way encryption): passwords, authentication, file integrity verification, etc.
    Website certificates to verify authenticity.

cryptography is used so widely and has many different implementations, there are several ways for vulnerabilities to occur. This could be through implementation errors, using weak encryption methods, not encrypting data at all, and much more. 
Therefore, a Cryptographic Failure vulnerability is a broad vulnerability category that encompasses all types of attacks that are related to anything cryptography related.

How to Find Cryptographic Failures

    Identify Insecure Transport Layer (e.g., No HTTPS)
    Detect Weak Encryption Algorithms
    Locate Hard-coded or Exposed Keys and Passwords
    Audit for Unencrypted Sensitive Data Storage
    Check for Weak Password Storage

Impact of Cryptographic Failures

    Risk of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
    Vulnerability to Cipher Exploits (e.g., Sweet32)
    Unauthorized Access via Exposed Credentials
    Data Exposure through Unencrypted Backups
    Increased Password Cracking Risk

Fixes for Cryptographic Failures

    Enforce HTTPS
    Upgrade to Strong Encryption Algorithms
    Use Secure Storage for Credentials and Keys
    Encrypt All Sensitive Data at Rest
    Apply Strong Password Hashing and Storage
